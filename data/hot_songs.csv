I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello.""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said...

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said...

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

Romeo, save me, they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's a real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.""

Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town 
And I said...

""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say...yes!""

It didn't ever get you far

And you never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

And the truth be told I miss you
And the truth be told I'm lyin'

When you see my face hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell

Tommorow you'll be thinking to yourself:
""Where did I go wrong?""
But the list goes on and on

But the truth be told I miss you
And the truth be told I'm lyin'

When you see my face hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell

Now, you'll never see what you've done to me
You can take back your memories, they're no good to me
And here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look that you wear so well

(When you see my face hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell)

Ever had one of them days you wish you would've stayed home?
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em
Figure you get jumped, here that's next
So they don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin'
You to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you're hit 4 times, bullet hit your spine
Paralyzed waist down, now ya wheelchair bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think it all started you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday
All over bullshit dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be 'cos of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow I guess
From Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take

Niggas start shit, next thing you know we cappin'
Get locked up then didn't even get mad
Now I think about ""Damn, what a life I had""
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit still look back get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door.
Who would've thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more
I had done took that ass whippin' now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me alright

Just livin' my life, my life, my life
Just livin' my life, my life, my life

Nevermind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say, I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day

Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay, and no, they couldn't get work on Labor Day

It ain't that black or white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm West Side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away

I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make them put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You rather see me catch a case, then watch my future fade away

You're gonna be a shining star
With fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you see, you're gonna go far

Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin,' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money, and I'm not goin' nowhere

So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
And look in the mirror, and keep on shinin'

We gon' post up on the top spot

The moment you've all been waiting for...
In this corner: weighing 175 pounds,
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world:
Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh, uh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ok! Let's go!

Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick frumunda cheese from under my nuts

It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man they love me when I lay in the cut
Fist the cup, the lady give her eighty some paper cut

Now picture us, it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes

It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention, ""It's true""
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

They see that low rider go by, they like, ""Oh, my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that six tre like, ""Sick 'em, Dre""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me

But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again

I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado

The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like precision collision
Or maico, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe

I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marajaun do what you want

Nigga on and on till the break of what?
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, Mafucker, I'm grown

I stunt, I style, I flash the shit

On Fifth Avenue

All that we can hear

Man we ain't talked since we left
It's so overdue
It's cold outside
But between us it's worse in here

The world slows down but my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part where the end starts

I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through my fingers

I don't want to try now

Find a way that I can tell you

I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

Everyday several takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now 'fore we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you it's hurting me

To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of, but dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing; I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene, straight off the silver screen

So I'll be holding my own breath, right up 'til the end
Until that moment when I find the one that I'll spend forever with

'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street; out in the moonlight
And, damn it, this feels too right
It's just like déjà vu; me, standing here with you

Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student

And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later

He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, Leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try,
So live like you'll never live it twice

Shit, I wish it was, but even though it wasn't,
We still doing donuts and I'm half a dozen,
They call me Krispy Kreme, my style is crispy clean
I drive some chicks on these crews, that's some crispy jeans
Ask how much?
Now what I look like?
Son I'm from Brooklyn, what it look like?
I get it 'cause I got it
I got it so you get it
I gave shortie some till she say, oh I get it!
And now that you got it
Put it in the bag
Write your number down
Just put it on the tab.

The same thing that the bankrobber told the teller
Just throw it in the bag
That's the way it suppose to be
A real nigga 'posed to help you out with the groceries
Just throw it in the bag
Paper or plastic? It's safer to ask it
So get that nigga I will pay for the casket
That Remy ma got you talkin' plenty huh?
Broke ass nigga couldn't buy the mini bar
So get with Loso
He ain't got to know so
I'm a gentlemen I send a bottle with that Rose tho'
Oh you gotta man well you need a richer one
Meet me in the parking lot, the plates say 'getchu1'
Meet me at the register

And don't leave the house till the booze gone
And don't have sex if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new joint

Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun

And three weeks later in the front porch light

And I just can’t believe the way I feel about you girl

We’ve come so far since that day and I thought I loved you then

I remember, taking you back to right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There people around but I didn’t care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again, I thought I loved you then

I can just see you when your hair is turning grey
What I can’t see is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I’ve said that before

And now you’re my whole life, now you’re my whole world

And it's hard to understand, you got another plan
Tryin' to play hard, that you got another man,

I'm just style freein, freestylin which I seldom do
This is what I'm telling you
To the bed I'm nailing you
Like I've been in jail for two
Years and then they let me loose

Give me the greenlight...
Give me just one night.
I'm ready to go right now!
I'm ready to go right now
We can go all night
Give me the greenlight
I'm ready to go right now

Sometimes you gotta step from behind the piano
And let 'em know what's going on

Were at the bar and we
Were havin' us some beers and
Swappin' I don't cares
Talkin' politics
Blonde and redhead chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked

We talked about Gods grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the old man say,
""God is great, beer is good and People Are Crazy""

He said ""I fought two wars,
Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said ""Damn if I know""
We talked an hour or two
About every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys will do

We pondered life and death
He light a cigarette
He said ""These damn things will kill me yet,
But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy""

Last call its 2:00am
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again

Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page Obituary
He was a millionaire he
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
Huh but me, I'm doing well
And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said God is great, beer is good and people are crazy

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

B.o.B
Yeah
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion

And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at that phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back

But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel
And they sayin' ""What would you wish for?""
If you had one chance

So airplane, airplane
Sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

B.o.B
Yeah, yeah
Somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank

Yeah back when I was tryin' to get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessing that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Then maybe yo maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur, what's up Bobby Ray?

So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fucking hates me and I love it, wait

Where you going, I'm leaving you, no you ain't
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped ""who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em

You'd swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each others' face, spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push pull each others' hair, scratch claw bit 'em
Throw 'em down pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls ya both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over

But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Rihanna:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Eminem:
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
But when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please

Come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall

Next time, there will be no next time, I apologize
Even though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games
I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Rihanna:

For when I'm a billionaire

Travie McCoy
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit

Give away a few Mercedes like, ""Here lady, have this""
And last, but not, least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single, so
You can call me Travie Claus, minus the ho ho

Get it, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music

Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and Bens completely separate

And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession, but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks

And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing

Everybody (I guess I had to) (everybody), come take my hand (Go to that place) (come take my hand) (To get to this one)
We'll walk this road together (Now some of you) through the storm
Whatever weather (Might still be in that place) cold or warm (If you're tryin to get out)
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone (Just follow me)
Holla if you feel like (I'll get you there) you've been down the same road

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper, before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words, before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin' I do it, I don't give a damn

What you think, I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who looked down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony

No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album, he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

OK quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm, for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that
Fuck your feelin's, instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped

And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-bloww
'Cause I ain't playin' around, there's a game called circle
And I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down

But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around, but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like, you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you

I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers

No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it

'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin' and I'm not

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) to take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody), come take my hand (come take my hand)

Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes, yes
I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said
I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine

I ain't ashamed of calling your name girl

I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
Not even for a minute
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon hear me say

When ya no longer involved that person has it all,

I need a paramedic girl, I'm feeling paralyzed,
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me,
The more money I made you acting like my enemy,
Its crazy, I can't help it if you feel ashamed,
Lots of pressure will turn you into my diamond babe,

Closest friends get estranged when the status change,
Ah, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at,
And my whole wild ... is the only one that had my back,

To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest sh-t,

Cooler then the flip side of my pillow, that's right

Nothing can compare to where you send me
Let me know that it's okay, yeah it's okay
And the moments when my good times start to fade

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night

You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold, buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile

Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack 
And just like that
You steal away the rain and just like that

You make me smile like the sun
Fall out of bed, sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head, spin like a record

Forget how to breathe

Don't know how I lived without you
'Cause every time that I get around you
I see the best of me inside your eyes

You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Near me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me

Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in

Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids who don't wanna be there
None for the niggas trying to hold them back
Five in the air for the teacher not scared
To tell those kids that's living in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back that the world is theirs!

Yeah yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world
Now I'm on a world tour
I will give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghettos girls and boys I'm rapping around the world for!

Africa to New York, Haiti then I detour, Oakland out to Auckland

Tell 'em look at me, boy!

Eminem:
By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightning
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em' skyward, uh

Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fucking illest in this music

There is or there ever will be, disagree
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
The only thing I ever gave up's using, no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building

And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, 'cause cock backwards is still cock, you pricks

I love it when I tell 'em shove it 'cause it wasn't that
Long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, flustered
'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz, and now you wonder

Why he does it, how he does it, wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it
Or was it 'cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass, 'cause fuck, guess it doesn't matter now, does it

What difference it make, what's it take, to get it through your thick skulls
If this ain't, some bullshit people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a hater's rib cage

And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em Bics raise 'cause I came with 5'9"" but I feel like I'm 6'8""

Buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi

And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him to know it

I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I right

Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meow, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao

Y'all are doomed, I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and autotunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston, I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick

And now I'm fantastic, compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly

I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday

I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming

I'm back where I belong
Yeah I never felt so strong
I'm feelin' like there's nothing that I can't try
(I'm back, baby)

(Put your hands high)

If you ever lost a life before, this one's for you
(And if you with me put your hands high)
And you, and you and you and you
(Your dreams are filled, you're rapping with the best)

I hear ""The Tears Of A Clown"", I hate that song
I feel like they talking to me when it comes on
Another day another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone

What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on
It's easy to be Puff, but it's harder to be Sean
What if the twins ask why I ain't marry they mom?
(Why? Damn)
How do I respond?

What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Damn, but I ain't finished growin'
Another night the inevitable prolongs

Another day, another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place I belong

""A house Is Not A Home"", I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?
And people got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it

But you felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, play boy, and we keep ballin'

Baby, we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your own, pick up your phone, come on

""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
Till back cruising through Harlem, Viso blocks

It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away than embraced me, forgave me
For all of my shortcomings, welcome to my homecoming
Yeah it's been a long time coming

Lot of fights, lot of scars
Lot of bottles, lot of cars
Lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog

And here I stand, a better man
(A better man)
Thank you Lord

I'm getting so cold
I ain't work this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don't mean
Like what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy
But get it while you here boy
'Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot with a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumours, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations, I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it!

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya
I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one

Money that we got, never get that shit

I said fuck it I'm on one

I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognise the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I out on bond I might be facin' 8's
Still running with the same niggas till the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair (Khaled)

I should dust something
You niggas on the bench

Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the swishas
I'm focused might as well say cheese for the pictures
Oh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant

Put an end to the world like Mayans

Let's go...
Yeah
You're listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials

'Cause I got more hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man I'm like a young gun fully black Barack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack

I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk
So down to Earth

I'm bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed

Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
Where the hell's all the sanity at, damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about

Yeah, I needed a change
When we ate we never tipped 'cause we needed the change
I needed a break
For a sec I even gave up believing and praying

I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed

Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn't going nowhere, running man!

I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just have to keep screaming until they hear you out

Staying up, playing back myself leavin'

And I think about summer, all the beautiful times

And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was ""Goodbye""

Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy, never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody's gonna miss me anyway

Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever gonna go away

'Cause now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy, never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet, sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be

Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy, never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Grab a backpack of lies

When you lose yourself

Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in hell's kitchen with an apron and a hairnet

Devil on my shoulder, the Lord is my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hoola hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful

Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap

But I'm, Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

Told me ""Baby it's real.""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel

Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about ""I"" give the rest of the vowels back

I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her till she cry, call that ""wine and dine""
Try to check me and imma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen

Rocking like the asphalt, it's the cash's fault
Looked in the face of death and took it's mask off

Oh, but you were so shy and so was I

Are we gonna do this or what
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're 'bout to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not

It was the best dang kiss that I'd ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask
For your hand
So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band
And I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me

Are you gonna kiss me or not
Are we gonna do this or what

I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not

From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
And your momma cried when you walked down the aisle
When the preacher man said say I Do
I did, and you did, too

It's even harder to picture that you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it but is it too late to try
And in that time that you wasted, all of our bridges burned down

You turned your back on tomorrow, 'cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow, but you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine, I don't expect you to care

Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me I'm stunnin'

Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'

Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top, or what you could've saw

You hate the fact, that you bought the dream, when they sold you one

Saw you downtown singing the blues

But I never realized that you wanted to be mine
So I gave her the ring instead of you, nickname too
I can tell you're upset because it ain't you

Met a new girl and I gave her my heart

Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip-flops and cut-off jeans

Somewhere between that setting sun
'I'm On Fire' and 'Born To Run'
You looked at me and I was done
And we, we're just gettin' started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Sang 'Ooh, ooh'

Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound
Of you sayin', ""Don't go""

When I think about you, I think about seventeen
I think about my old Jeep, I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night, Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name, I bet
There'd still be a spark

From back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
'Bout your name on my arm

Baby, is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio

Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear 'Born In The U.S.A'
Do you relive those glory days
So long ago

When you think about me, do you think about seventeen?
Do you think about my old Jeep? Think about the stars in the sky?

She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art

She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect

What your fantasy?
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up
Be my señorita

Soaking up the sunlight

We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the wall's with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo

Got the stars coming out over my hood

Gonna cuss the morning when it comes
'Cause I know the rising sun
Ain't no good for me

Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Somewhere between like, Rocky and Cosby, Sweater Gang
Nope, nope, y'all can't copy

Yup, bad, moonwalkin', this here, is our party
My posse's been on Broadway and we did it our way
Grown music
I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on

Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got the Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town

Trust me, I'm a I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler

Spread it across the country, labels out here
Nah they can't tell me nothing, we give it to the people

But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you

And I'm eating at the beat
Like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on Shark Week

I've got a world to see;
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes
So I'm giving it back to the people now
Sing that song and it goes like

Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said

When I was in the third grade
I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was
And I kept my room straight

I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?

A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like
""Yeah, I'm good at little league""

A preconceived idea of what it all meant
For those who liked the same sex, had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision

And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a predisposition
Playing God

Ah nah, here we go
""America the brave"" still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all His children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

Mary Lambert:

Even if I wanted to
And I can't change

Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

Macklemore:
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're saying
Our culture founded from oppression
Yeah, we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself

When I was in church, they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
And that holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen

I might not be the same
But that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal
Damn right I support it
I don't know

Mary Lambert:
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change

She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

Macklemore:
We press play
Don't press pause
Progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can united by law
Kids are walkin' around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful
Someone would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up

Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan quake losers and survivors

Norway, no you didn't get my flowers
No way to sound better but the killer was a coward
Face just showers, the minute in an hour
Heard about the news, all day went sour

Lil' mama got me feeling like a limit here
Put you in the box just like the president's cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless

Get mad 'cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I or jealousy was not oppressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined

And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get depressed 'cause the outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all, get a meal ticket

Clean next, get a call, just a lil' visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Rihanna kiss you on ya neck, just kill critics
Bugatti never when I'm rich, just God fearing

Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Mr. Mike Caren, tell his Billie jeans
I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck, or Lee Prince Perries

Tryna live, tryna figure how my sister vanish

It's killing me to see you this way

There's an old voice in my head that's holdin' me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past

And full of life and full of love

Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man

An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the Fourth of July

You swore and said, ""We are not,
We are not shining stars.""
This I know
I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
To know you can never look back

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on

Carry on, carry on

So I met up with some friends at the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives

But I'd like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you are to me

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
And carry on

Woah, my head is on fire
But my legs are fine
After all, they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door, hold the phone, show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now

'Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are

On our darkest day
When we're miles away
Sun will come
We will find our way home

Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation

First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world and now we're just fucking
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
B-by m-me believing what you say that you never mean
Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got him mirrored
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing

I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breathe for it
Till you do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air and you leave for it
Till they have a cat scan that check on your mind and it's nothin' but me (on it, on it...)
Now it's me time believe that
If it's yours when you want it, I wouldn't promise I need that

She said ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away four months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

For a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about
She should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love

Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck

Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is

Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss

If he would have played it just one more time

I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove

Are you somewhere feeling lonely even know he's right beside you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

I remember the makeup running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them

I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone

Looking down from heaven like damn that's stylish
Smilin', don't pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? I'm illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I'm smashing
I'm ducking bucking them out here
I'm lookin' fuckin' fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it's like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I'd have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, Candy paint, two seater
Yeah, I'm from Seattle, There's hella Honda Civics
I couldn't tell you about paint either
But I really want the Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I'm dreaming of, as I bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in and as I was leaving I started screaming

Hollis
Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm blowin' that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

ScHoolboy Q
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snorting coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had it hella my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14 years out so excuse me and my niggas was gone
Sendin' portions of his liquor, water in the Patrón
Rather smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it and the vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keeping the buns on 'em
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin' like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all, kill the fuckin' wimps
See what's poppin' at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my palms
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe... some
Swear these eyes tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Girl does she want it low?
This shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted for showing gangstas in it
Slide till the gas is finished, Q

That one day I will be, where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy, daily

I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away four months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

For a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about
She should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time, God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't fuck with my love

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested

Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party, I'll be here

Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollerin' I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with the message, (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here

Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up

To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart

About myself, I'm sorry

Where nothing ever happened?

Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely

It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old

Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still rolling
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me

Some girl talkin' 'bout a hater, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'

Eating peanut butter and jellyfishes on toast

That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow

And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothing but pain

Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne

Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it

Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away, too

Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile

He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely.""
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

""Run, run, lost boy."" they say to me
""Away from all of reality.""

Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny

As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods

Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom bom

Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise till death we part

I ain't cried since '01, my pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though, your friend ain't cute but it's fine though

I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Whoa, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screening out the lane
Went from ""Damn this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Riding deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)
So don't fuck with me, no, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I could go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark

I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here, made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way, driving at ninety down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, and I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when we found
Weekend jobs when we got paid we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

Hey lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga touch my gang we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck cost me 10 times 3
30,000 dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like 10 Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like 10 phones, damn I'm really never home
All these niggas clones tryna copy what I'm on
Nigga get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother Skip, boy I had a good day
Metro PCS trappin' boy I'm making plays
50 shades of grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze

Said that I can hit that shit so greasily

She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego
I should sauce 'em up like Prego
Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was 5 or 6 years old when I had told myself ok you're special
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was 26 years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world stepping
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the why you got to stare face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearing
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese bitch I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party getting lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie word to my mami

In the middle of the party bitch get off me
In the cut I'm rolling up my broccoli

Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh

I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one

Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Did this shit in the past
But I want it to last

I was tangled up in your drastic ways

Are you staring a hole through your phone praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Maybe playing some Mayer getting lost in your favorite lines?

You just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

And I'm one number away from calling to you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away

Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite song?
Maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on

If you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door
